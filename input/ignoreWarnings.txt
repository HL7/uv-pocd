# Example observation in this IG are supposed to be device generated with often an unknown performer. There is text in the IG to explain this. The affected example observations / bundles are: bits-observation.json, bundle-continuousnonin.json, bundle-example-1.json, coin-20181119174911.json, coin-20181119202022.json, coin-example-1.json, coin-example-timefault.json, glucose-1.0.0.4.json, numeric-observation-not-a-number.json, numeric-spotnumeric.json, stringenum-1234.json
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
